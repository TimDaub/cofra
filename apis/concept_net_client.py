"""
`rest_client.py`_ is a simple client for interacting with ConceptNet 5's REST
API.

.. _`rest_client.py`: https://github.com/commonsense/conceptnet/blob/master/conceptnet/webapi/rest_client.py

This client is not object-oriented. The data structures you work with are
dictionaries, of the form described in the API documentation. The main function
:func:`lookup` can be used to look up many different kinds of data. There are
also convenience functions for performing common operations on this data.

If you want to know what fields are contained in these dictionaries, read
the REST API documentation at
http://csc.media.mit.edu/docs/conceptnet/webapi.html#rest-requests .
